**This project is designed to apply our knowledge of Supervised learning algorithms.
**

Things to learn:

How to identify when preprocessing is needed, and how to apply it.
How to establish a benchmark for a solution to the problem.
What each of several supervised learning algorithms accomplishes given a specific dataset.
How to investigate whether a candidate solution model is adequate for the problem.
