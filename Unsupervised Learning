In this project, we have been provided with two datasets, one with demographic information about the people of Germany, and one with that same information for customers of a mail-order sales by Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Financial Solutions. Weâ€™ll look at relationships between demographics features, organize the population into clusters, and see how prevalent customers are in each of the segments obtained.
